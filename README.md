# KMeans_Clustering
Clustering mall customers dataset based on 'Annual Income' and 'Spending Score'.
This is Unsupervised machine learning technique to cluster datapoints with respect to some features.
Here I have used elbow method over WCSS values to find optimum number of clusters.
So it has given me 5 Clusters that are also plotted for better understanding.
